so good they call me a robot
212 is greater than 7
You weren't on your guard and we took you down hard like Germany hostile takeover
Mit wants me so much that im 16 and I got accepted by letter
Magic call me harry potter
Might have a Shroud but got nowhere to hide
It ain't no contest you know we won
You weren't on your guard and we took you down hard like Germany hostile takeover
If you went against us you know that you'd flop
Silence is a friend that never betrays
